			<p> Hi there! Nice to see you here! <br>

My name is Niina, I was born& raised in Vantaa, Finland but I am currently living in Munich, Germany. 
 <br>

<br>

Currently, I'm an EMEA Export Customer Service & Team Coordinator at an International sports brands company.
<br>
I handle a portfolio of five different sports brands.  Each brand has their processes, administration and logistical centers.  

<br>
<br>
My daily tasks include planning shipments, handling logistical processes and providing the best possible customer service. 
To manage the order- delivery process to our customers, I communicate with supply chains and logistical centers in Europe regarding processes, products and regulations. 
I am also managing vendor direct processes from external factories in Asia to our distributors in EMEA.
<br>
<br>
I am a professional in my current job and courious to take the next step to new challenges.
I am looking for new opportunities and I am interested in learning new skills.
<br>
<br>
I finished my HTML/CSS studies at the end of January 2020 at  <a href="https://www.redi-school.org/" target="_blank">ReDI School of Digital Integration</a>
- I am looking forward continuing to Javascript in next semester. I really enjoy studying more coding, IT and everything digital.
<br>
I want to go more into the digital world and land a job in the field of eCommerce, SaaS, dealing with Online platforms or anything related to these.
<br>
<br>
It will still be a long road, but as I am focused and open to learning new tasks, I see only positive things ahead.
<br>


<br>
In my free time, I am making a lot of effort to improve my digital & photography skills. I like traveling, exploring places and doing self-development. <br> 
<br>
Some people say that I am brave as I have traveled around the world alone. 
I say that I am brave because I am looking for a new career and  I have put myself out there & published this site  with full of information about myself. 
Most probably several hundreds of people get to see this  - Now that is a brave thing to do!
